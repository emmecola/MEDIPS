Description: MEDIPS was originally developed for analyzing data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). 
	However, calculation of differential coverage between groups of samples as well as saturation and correlation analyses can be applied to any other type of quantitative sequencing data. 
	MEDIPS addresses several aspects in the context of IP-seq data analysis including several quality controls, normalization, and identification of differential covergae.
