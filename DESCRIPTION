Description: MEDIPS was developed for analyzing data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq). 
	However, MEDIPS provides several functionalities for the analysis of other kinds of quantitative sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-seq, MBD-seq, CMS-seq and others) including
	calculation of differential coverage between groups of samples as well as saturation and correlation analyses.
