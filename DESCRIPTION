Description: MEDIPS was developed for analyzing data derived from methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) experiments followed by sequencing (MeDIP-Seq). 
	Nevertheless, functionalities like the quality controls may be applied to other types of sequencing data (e.g. ChIP-Seq). 
	MEDIPS adresses several aspects in the context of MeDIP-Seq data analysis.
